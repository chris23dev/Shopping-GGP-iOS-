The JMap.framework is embedded in the GGP Malls target from /JMapSDK/JMap.framework

The file itself is ignored from git. It is copied to that location from a Build Phase
build script. The script copies from JMap/Prod if the configuration is Release and from
JMapSDK/Dev for all other configurations.
